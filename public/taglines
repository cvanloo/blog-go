a blog about programming <weird> computers using <weird> languages.
where the <blind> are leading the <blind>.
officially the <worst> place to get your <news> about V系, J-Rock, and K-Pop.
until the <love> runs <out>.
too busy asking if I <could>, never stopping to ask if I <should>.
may your <coffee> kick in, before <reality> does.
what is <lost>, will be <found>.
<dazed> and <confused>, but trying to continue.
<new> sounds better than <malloc>.
Miyazaki <wishes> he could make a <boss> this hard.
where I <stand> is where I <fall>.
but <these> go to <eleven>.
not a <saint> but keeping my <appointments>.
nobody <comes>, nobody <goes>, it's <awful>.
a <miserable> little pile of <secrets>.
really <tightening> those <bolts>.
every <dream> goes.
<ピンク>じゃない、<マゼンタ>だ。
the rest of the <sun> belongs to <me>.
putting <fun> back in <fundamentally flawed>.
ein <Leben> lang <unsterblich>.
temporary, I hope hope hope.
<forever> is longer than you <think>.
colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
you're a tiny catboy, he's a German, I'm a therapist, let's get nuts.
