a blog about programming <weird> computers using <weird> languages.
where the <blind> are leading the <blind>.
officially the <worst> place to get your <news> about Vç³», J-Rock, and K-Pop.
until the <love> runs <out>.
too <preoccupied> with whether or not I <could>.
may your <coffee> kick in, before <reality> does.
what is <lost>, will be <found>.
<dazed> and <confused>, but trying to continue.
<new> sounds better than <malloc>.
Miyazaki <wishes> he could make a <boss> this hard.
where I <stand> is where I <fall>.
